# Address Book

Basic address book app using JavaFX.
Database handled using MySQL. Currently only allows the user that owns the database to login and interact with the app.
Assumes database structure has already been set up as it stands. This will be changed.

Testing has been added. For a number of tests user credentials are required to log into the database. This should be placed in a test.properties file inside the config folder in the below format:
- db.url=xxx
- db.user=xxx
- db.password=xxx
